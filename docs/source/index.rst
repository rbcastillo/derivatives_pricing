Welcome to the documentation for Derivatives Pricing!
======================================================

This is a personal project aimed at facilitating my own learning and providing a resource for others interested in
this field. The objective is to build a comprehensive collection of derivative pricing tools and utilities, with a
commitment to expanding it as my knowledge in this domain grows.

It's important to note that this project is not geared toward commercial applications or achieving the highest level
of speed and efficiency in derivative pricing, as there are numerous existing solutions that fulfill these purposes.
Instead, the primary goal is to create a code project where the calculations and underlying logic are presented in the
most comprehensible manner possible. This approach is intended to assist individuals in grasping the theoretical
foundations of derivative pricing.
